# Bike-sharing-analysis

This project explores hourly bike-sharing demand to understand how mobility behavior shifts across weekdays vs weekends and different weather conditions.
The analysis identifies two overlapping systems within the same network:

- Routine Mobility System — schedule-driven commuter peaks dominant on working days

- Adaptive Leisure System — flexible, weather-sensitive midday activity more visible on weekends

Using Pandas-based EDA and statistical reasoning, the project examines temporal rhythms, environmental effects, and demand variability to build a behavioral model of urban bike usage.
